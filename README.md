# Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming
## A familiar problem
### By creating a familiar problem domain, I found that both the tasks of me teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.
### Simply that by taking away the problem domain, or making it so trivial that it is easily understood, I am able to make both teaching and learning easier.
## Why problem domains are hard
### The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.
### Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.
### The real world is a messy place.  Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoint.
### As programmers, we also are often not given complete information about the problem domain, so we don’t even have the information we need to understand it.
## Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain
###  It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question.  It’s like buzzing in on Jeopardy before you hear the clue and shouting out random questions.
## What can you do about it?
### If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

### 1-Make the problem domain easier

### 2-Get better at understanding the problem domain

### You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.
